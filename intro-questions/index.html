        <h1>Intro-Questions  Jonathan Feehan</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>1. My name is Jonathan Feehan, I am majoring in Computer Science and I am a junior</li>
            <li>2. I took this class because I feel like although I understand the technical aspects of web development, I definitely lack the creative skill to make good looking websites.</li>
            <li>3. I do have experience with html, css, and JS as well as some backend languages such as php and python. I took a course last semester that focused on web development and learning new frameworks</li>
            <li>4. I hope to be able to learn some basic design principles in order to make better looking websites</li>
            <li>5. Designing for screen means being able to make a design that is reponsive on many different platforms and may be subject to millions of different situations and therefore has to be quite robust in how its created.</li>
            <li>6. <a href = https://www.airbnb.com/ >https://www.airbnb.com/</a> The airbnb website has a very appealing front page that encourages the user to explore the site </li>
            <li>7. <a href = https://www.dell.com/en-us >https://www.dell.com/en-us</a> In my opinion dells website gives a fairly straight forward aproach and allows users to easily navigate their products</li>
            <li>8. <a href = https://www.w3schools.com/> https://www.w3schools.com/ </a> While this website may not be the best stylistically speaking it works well. I have not had any issues with any part of the website not working. It is a website that I used extensively last year</li>
